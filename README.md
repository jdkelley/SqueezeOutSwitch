# SqueezeOutSwitch

Hi guys! Here is the sample of code presentation of animated UI element. It is based on the <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2237700-Switch-Control-Animation" rel="nofollow">Switch Control Animation</a> designed by <a href="http://tubikstudio.com" rel="nofollow">Tubik Studio</a>. It was a concept of a switcher allowing users to turn on and off some functions. The main motion design style was some gum effect when the control is switched on and off and that was the challenge solved here in code.
